# syslog2

[![Clippy Linting Result](https://clippy.bashy.io/github/lemonrock/syslog2/master/badge.svg?style=plastic)](https://clippy.bashy.io/github/lemonrock/syslog2/master/log) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code%20Style-rustfmt-brightgreen.svg?style=plastic)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt#configuring-rustfmt)

[syslog2] is a rust crate that provides a correct, RFC-compliant syslog implementation and local libc wrapper; it re-uses libc functionality. It correctly models structured data (unlike other rust implementations) and support logging to standard error on Solaris and Windows (which lack such functionality natively).

A future direction is to add support for logging to Windows Event Log.

This crate supports logging to [loggly](https://www.loggly.com/docs/streaming-syslog-without-using-files/) using custom structured data.
